# SVG Logo Maker Challenge

## Description

This application was desgined to generate a logo using SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) and user input. Through this application users can make a simple logo for professional use. The application allows for users to enter text in their logo, and to select a shape for thier SVG using the three most common shapes of circle, square, and triangle. In addition, users are able to select the color of the text and shape of their logo thgrough the use of color names or hex color values thus allowing for more methods of personalization.

## Installation

Node.js and NPMs: Inquirer and Jest

## Usage

HTML, JavaScript, Markdown

## Demos

Links below show functionality of the application.

``` **Important:** Within the videos linked below, when demonstarting the ability to determine a color for the shape and text of the svg both hex color value and color name are used. Thus showing the ability for users to do the same.```
